			<h1>About this database</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the public (inofficial) OpenGL ES hardware database, an online tool for developers that want to check out the OpenGL hardware capabilites for the different<br>
				graphics cards, operating systems and driver versions out there.<br><br>
				This database and the tools to fill it are developed and maintained by me (<a href="http://www.saschawillems.de/" target="_blank">Sascha Willems</a>) in my spare time.<br>
				No profit is made from this data, nor is this data used in any commercial way and no personal data is transferred, stored or passed.<br><br>
				If you want to contribute to the development, you can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/SaschaWillems/glESCapsViewerWeb" target="_blank">https://github.com/SaschaWillems/glESCapsViewerWeb</a>.
